The Tic Tac Toe game is a simple web-based game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It allows two players to take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw. 
The game utilizes HTML for the layout and structure, CSS for styling the elements, and JavaScript for handling game logic and interactivity.
Players can click on the grid cells to make their moves, and the game checks for win conditions after each move to determine the winner or if the game is a draw. 
The game provides a fun and engaging way for players to challenge each other in the classic Tic Tac Toe competition directly within their web browsers.
